## Local Development



### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm

### Setup

1. Clone or download this repository

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm run install-all
```

This will install dependencies for both the backend and frontend.

### Running the Application

#### Development Mode (Recommended)

Run both backend and frontend simultaneously:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- Backend server on `http://localhost:5000`
- Frontend development server on `http://localhost:3000`

The app will automatically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Running Separately

**Backend only:**
```bash
npm run server
```

**Frontend only:**
```bash
npm run client
```

### Managing Inventory

4. Click into the deck to start building

   - Use search and color filters

## Database

The application uses SQLite with a local database file (`backend/mtg.db`) that is automatically created on first run. Your data persists between sessions.

### Database Schema

- **inventory**: Stores your card collection
- **decks**: Stores deck metadata
- **deck_cards**: Links cards to decks with quantities

## API Endpoints

### Inventory
- `GET /api/inventory` - Get all cards in inventory
- `GET /api/inventory/:id` - Get single card
- `POST /api/inventory` - Add card to inventory
- `PUT /api/inventory/:id` - Update card details
- `DELETE /api/inventory/:id` - Remove card
- `POST /api/inventory/update-prices` - Update all prices

### Decks
- `GET /api/decks` - Get all decks
- `GET /api/decks/:id` - Get deck with cards
- `POST /api/decks` - Create new deck
- `PUT /api/decks/:id` - Update deck
- `DELETE /api/decks/:id` - Delete deck
- `POST /api/decks/:id/cards` - Add card to deck
- `DELETE /api/decks/:deckId/cards/:cardId` - Remove card from deck

### Cards (Scryfall)
- `GET /api/cards/search?q=query` - Search for cards
- `GET /api/cards/named?name=cardname` - Get card by name

### Statistics
- `GET /api/stats` - Get collection statistics

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If port 5000 or 3000 is already in use:

```bash
# Change backend port
PORT=5001 npm run server

# Frontend proxy will need to be updated in client/package.json
```

### Database Issues

If you encounter database errors, delete `backend/mtg.db` and restart the server. A fresh database will be created.

### Scryfall API Rate Limiting

The Scryfall API requests a delay of 50-100ms between requests. The price update feature respects this limit automatically.

## Future Enhancements

Potential features to add:
- Export deck lists to various formats (Arena, MTGO, text)
- Import collection from CSV
- Advanced statistics and charts
- Card trading/wishlist features
- Multi-user support with authentication
- Mobile app version
- Card condition images
- Purchase history tracking

## Credits

- Card data and images provided by [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/)
- Built with React and Express
- Dark theme inspired by modern MTG Arena UI

## License

This is a personal project for managing your MTG collection. Card data is provided by Scryfall under their terms of service.
